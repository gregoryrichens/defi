# DeFi: A Trends Web application for Cryptocurrency && Decentralized Finance

## Description

A MERN stack web application for aggregating thoughts from crypto's leading voices (not talking heads or financial analysts) as well as reputable news sites that provide proven commentary. The point of the site is two-fold:
1) serve as an entry point to a weekly newsletter about crypto trends
2) provide an at-a-glance view of what's hot now and serve as a launching point to other websites/deeper investigation.
